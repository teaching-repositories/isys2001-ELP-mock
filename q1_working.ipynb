Your design should prompt the user for hours worked and hourly pay rate and calculate and display the gross pay. The application should allow the user to repeat the calculations for different inputs. Your design should demonstrate the first four steps of the development methodology: understand the problem, list inputs and outputs, work the problem by hand, develop an algorithm, and test the design.

        "2. \n",
        "<strong>Improved User Interface (UI):</strong> For a better user experience, consider creating a more interactive and user-friendly interface. For example, in a graphical user interface (GUI), you could provide form fields for entering hours and rate, and buttons to calculate and reset.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. \n",
        "<strong>Detailed Error Messages:</strong> Provide detailed and helpful error messages that guide the user to correct their mistake. For instance, you might differentiate between an error caused by a non-numeric input and an error caused by a negative number.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. \n",
        "<strong>Documentation:</strong> Commenting your code thoroughly will make it easier to understand and maintain. Each function should have a comment explaining what it does, what parameters it expects, and what it returns.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. \n",
        "<strong>Logging:</strong> Depending on the use case of your application, you might want to add logging to record each calculation performed. This could be useful for debugging or for auditing purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. \n",
