        "**Assistant:**\n",
        "\n",
        "To improve the given code and make it follow industry practices, you can consider the following suggestions:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Use meaningful variable names: Instead of single-letter variable names like `x` and `y`, use more descriptive names that reflect the purpose of the variables. This improves code readability and maintainability.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "x = int(input(\"Enter value for x: \"))\n",
        "print(\"The square of x is\", x * x)\n",
        "y = input(\"Enter value for y: \")\n",
        "print(\"The product of x and y is\", x * y)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Format string output: Instead of using commas to separate values in the print statements, use formatted strings (f-strings) to make the code more readable and concise.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "x = int(input(\"Enter value for x: \"))\n",
        "print(f\"The square of x is {x * x}\")\n",
        "y = input(\"Enter value for y: \")\n",
        "print(f\"The product of x and y is {x * int(y)}\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Handle potential input errors: When taking user input, it's important to handle potential errors or unexpected input. You can use try-except blocks to catch exceptions and handle them gracefully.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "try:\n",
        "    x = int(input(\"Enter value for x: \"))\n",

        "except ValueError:\n",
        "    print(\"Invalid input. Please enter valid numeric values.\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Use parentheses for mathematical operations: Include parentheses around mathematical operations to make the code more explicit and ensure the intended order of operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "try:\n",
        "    x = int(input(\"Enter value for x: \"))\n",

        "    print(\"Invalid input. Please enter valid numeric values.\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Add spaces around operators and after colons: Including spaces around operators and after colons enhances readability and adheres to common coding style conventions.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "try:\n",
        "    x = int(input(\"Enter value for x: \"))\n",

        "    print(\"Invalid input. Please enter valid numeric values.\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Improve the if-else statement: In the if-else statement, use proper indentation and add a space after the comma in the print statement. Also, make sure to convert the input `y` to an integer before performing comparisons.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "try:\n",
        "    x = int(input(\"Enter value for x: \"))\n",
        "    print(f\"The square of x is {x ** 2}\")\n",
        "    y = int(input(\"Enter value for y: \"))\n",
        "    print(f\"The product of x and y is {x * y}\")\n",
        "    if x > y:\n",
        "        print(\"The difference is\", x - y)\n",
        "    else:\n",
        "        print(\"The difference is\", x - y)\n",
